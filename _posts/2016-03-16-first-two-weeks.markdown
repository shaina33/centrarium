Well, I’ve already finished the first two weeks of my program. It’s a good time to take a breath and think about what I’ve learned and accomplished so far in this brief time period. I’m already using the following tools and languages:

* HTML & CSS
* Bootstrap
* Ruby
* Rails
* RSpec
* Heroku
* Git & GitHub
* Command Line
* Markdown
* Jekyll & GitHub Pages

That’s a huge list! I’m pretty impressed with how easy Bloc has made it to dive right in to using real development tools. A few weeks ago, I would read all these terms while researching web development, but I had only a vague sense of what they might be. Mostly, it felt like impenetrable jargon. Now, I certainly still have tons to learn about these topics, but I have a general sense of what they’re used for, and how they work, and I can apply these skills in basic situations.

For example, before this program, I’ve never had my own website of any type. This week, I’ve launched two websites live to the world, using two different technologies. One is a Ruby on Rails project deployed to Heroku for my Bloc curriculum, and the other is this blog on GitHub Pages. That’s pretty exciting stuff as a new developer!

My experience so far just confirms that anyone can enter this jargon-filled world and learn to use these tools effectively. You just need time, dedication, and a learning environment! On that note, the Bloc mentorship system is already proving truly valuable. When I encounter an issue, I always try to solve it myself first, and I’m often successful, but it’s awesome to have someone that I can reach out to for a clear explanation, or help with debugging. Otherwise, I might get stuck on small things, like how to fix my GitHub branches or install Jekyll properly, and be prevented from really pushing onward. If I’ve already learned this much, I’m excited to see what I’ll do in the next few weeks!
