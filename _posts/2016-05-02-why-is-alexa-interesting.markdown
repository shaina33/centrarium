About a week ago, I finished working through Bloc’s Ruby on Rails curriculum, and the associated Bloccit Rails app that I was making. First major milestone completed!

Now I’m in the phase of working on backend projects to reinforce and expand what I learned in the Ruby on Rails backend curriculum. The first project that I chose to tackle is Bloc’s Alexa Project, offered in collaboration with Amazon. The challenge is to publish three skills for Amazon’s Alexa technology. Alexa is the virtual assistant featured in the Amazon Echo device and their Super Bowl [commercials]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTz5jAn-XX8) with Alec Baldwin.

Before this project, I was vaguely aware of the Amazon Echo, but didn’t know much about it. I thought Alexa was simply Amazon’s version of Siri, but Alexa is different in several interesting ways: 

1.	Alexa can be integrated into non-Amazon devices, such as the Invoxia Triby, which means her sphere of influence can really expand. Amazon is actively encouraging and supporting development of connected devices.

2.	All other virtual assistants, like Siri, live within a mobile device. This means they go with you when you travel, but it also means that the technology is limited specifically to you, and may not be nearby when you’re home. In contrast, Alexa is in the home, available to everyone, and can be used from across the room. She can be easily integrated into home activities when you’re not on your cell phone, such as cooking in the kitchen, or playing with your kids. She can also control household items, such as lights, speakers, thermostats, etc. Have you ever been super comfy on the couch with a book, and thought it would be so wonderful if you could just tell your lights to turn off from afar? This is it.

3.	New Alexa capabilities, called Skills, can be developed by third parties. Many big companies have already published voice skills to let Alexa interface with their service, including Uber, Domino’s Pizza, and Fidelity Investments. But it’s not just big companies; developers are publishing skills on a wide variety of topics. There are currently over 700 published 3rd party skills, and that number’s growing quickly.

4.	Alexa (in the Amazon Echo device) operates entirely eyes-free and hands-free, which opens doors for people with physical limitations. For example, someone that is paralyzed or unable to walk, is recovering from surgery, or has limited dexterity, could access web services and control their home environment, using only their voice and their ears. Imagine how much independence that could give people. What about your grandparents, who could call for help by voice if they fall down at home?

Once I’d done this research, I was much more intrigued by the opportunity to develop for Alexa. It also helps that my Bloc mentor, Mark Carpenter, is quite involved in the Alexa developer community and believes that Alexa and similar technology is the next big thing. If you’re interested, subscribe to his weekly newsletter, [ASK Dev Weekly](http://http://askdevweekly.com/).

In the last week, I’ve finished developing two simple Alexa Skills. The first one, which is available in the Alexa App now, is called Learn International Geography. As you could guess, it helps you learn international countries, cities, and famous landmarks through short trivia games. The second one is pending certification and should be available very soon. It just provides interesting facts about marine life. Knowledge of the international world and biology are two of my passions, so I had a good time researching these skills! I never get bored of reading on Wikipedia, and learned quite a few new facts in the process. Did you know the massive island of Greenland is associated with the tiny country of Denmark? Or that lobsters don’t show signs of aging?

I was excited to discover that the basic process of developing Alexa Skills is remarkably easy, so in my [next post](/adventures/2016/05/04/developing-2-skills-for-alexa.html), I’ll provide you with an intro to how it works and my experience so far!
