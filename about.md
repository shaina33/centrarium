My name is Shaina Karasin. Welcome to my blog! My background is in neuroscience and international education. I recently left my job to enroll full-time as a student in Bloc's Software Engineering Track program in order to pursue a new career in software & web development. You can read more about this decision in my [first blog post](https://bloc-foundation-shaina33-1.c9users.io/adventures/2016/03/14/welcome.html).

Beyond web development, I also enjoy reading, hiking, running, yoga, and traveling. I'm including one of my photos from my travels with each new blog post.

I hope you'll join me on this adventure! Please feel free to contact me or learn more about my work and experience using the links at the bottom of the page.
