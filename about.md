My name is Shaina Karasin. Welcome to my blog! I have an educational background in neuroscience, and a professional background in international education. I recently left my job to enroll full-time as a student in Bloc's Software Engineering Track program in order to pursue a new career in software & web development. You can read more about this decision in my [first blog post](http://shaina33.github.io/adventures/2016/03/14/welcome.html).

Beyond web development, I also enjoy reading, hiking & backpacking, yoga, salsa dancing, and traveling everywhere! I'm including one of my photos from my travels with each new blog post.

I hope you'll join me on this adventure! Please feel free to contact me or learn more about my work and experience using the links at the bottom of the page.
